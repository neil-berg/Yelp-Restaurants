## Motivation

[Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/developers) has a great developers program with powerful APIs that allows users to search for restaurants, food, drinks, etc. I wanted to build a React app based on this API to test out the new [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) and [React Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library).

## Features

* [Yelp Fusion](https://www.yelp.com/fusion) API connections
* [React-Leftlet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) to render zoomable maps of search results
* [React Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library) for behavioral-driven tests on React components

## Hosting

* Netlify for hosting and continous deployment
